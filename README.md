Xanthorox is designed as a powerful tool for cybersecurity professionals, including blue and red teamers. We do not support or condone the use of Xanthorox for illegal activities such as phishing, malware creation, or any form of cyber harm.

To reinforce our commitment to ethical use, we are implementing the following measures:

Enhanced Monitoring: An integrated AI system will now detect and flag content related to harmful activities.

Human Oversight: Flagged content will be reviewed to ensure compliance with our usage policies.

License Enforcement: Users found violating these policies will have their licenses revoked immediately.

These steps are in line with best practices for AI governance and aim to ensure that Xanthorox remains a tool for positive and lawful applications.

We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining the integrity and ethical standards of our community.
